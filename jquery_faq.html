                        Great Smoky Mountains National Park has been dubbed the "salamander capital of the world," and
                        it's home to 30 different species of "spring lizard," as they're called in Appalachia, including
                        the largest one in North America—the hellbender.

                        If you’re lucky, you may be able to witness a rare weather phenomenon called "total cloud
                        inversion," which sometimes occurs at the Grand Canyon when cool air gets trapped beneath a
                        layer of warm air creating a virtual sea of clouds.

                        Visitors can drive along the scenic Trail Ridge Road, which has been called the "highway to the
                        sky" because it soars two miles above sea level at its highest point. This 48-mile strip
                        connects Grand Lake and Estes Park and delivers unparalleled views of the forests, tundra, and
                        meadows below.

                        Only the adventurous can traverse The Subway in Zion National Park. To get to this tunnel carved
                        out of rock, visitors must hike for 9 miles (round-trip), scramble over boulders, climb down
                        waterfalls, and swim through creeks—"and the water is cold," according to Utah.com.

                        "Bear shows" were a popular tourist activity between 1890 and the 1940s, and the park eventually
                        installed wooden bleachers for spectators and a sign that read "Lunch Counter—For Bears Only."
                        Unsurprisingly, this set-up was a recipe for disaster.

                        A tradition was born where each summer evening at 9 p.m. sharp, someone would shout "Let the
                        fire fall!" before pushing embers over the edge. These shows were banned from 1913 to 1917, and
                        again during World War II, but they weren't officially eliminated until 1968. The National Park
                        Service said the man-made attraction was better suited to Disneyland than the natural world, and
                        reasoned that the huge crowds also damaged local meadows.

                        If you want to be the first person in America to see the sunrise, visit the top of Acadia's
                        Cadillac Mountain between October 7 and March 6. The 1528-foot peak is the highest point along
                        the North Atlantic, making it a great vantage point to watch the Atlantic Ocean's glistening
                        waters as they're bathed in sunlight

                        They called the three highest mountain peaks,  <em> les trois tétons </em>, which translates to "the three breasts" or "the three teats." It's believed that the trappers were referring specifically to Grand Teton, Teewinot Mountain, and Mt. Owen. At any rate, the name stuck and was later anglicized.
